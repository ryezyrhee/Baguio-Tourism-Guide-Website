      <h2><span>Baguio Museum</span>
        <p>Dot-PTA Complex, Gov. Pack Rd, Baguio</p>
        <p>Baguio Museum stands at the corner of Governor Park and Harrison Road.
          The building boasts Ifugao-inspired architecture such as a pyramid roof and two large poles situated by the entrance,
          which make the building resemble a traditional Ifugao hut that is often elevated from the ground by wooden posts.
          The museum displays various artifacts that depict the culture of the six provinces in the Cordillera region.
          The oldest artifacts here date all the way back to the 1950s. Along with the artifacts, you can also find scale maps, miniature models,
          and clippings about the region's history here. </p>

      <h2><span>Diplomat Hotel</span>
        <p>Dominican Hill, Diplomat Road, Baguio</p>
        <p>This eerie abandoned building with a dark history is said to be one of the most haunted places in the Philippines.
          The Dominican Hill Retreat House was built in 1913 atop a hill in the famed Philippine City of Pines.
          With the outbreak of World War II, it became a camp for refugees escaping the Japanese army,
          but was eventually invaded. The Japanese secret police, the Kempeitai, committed terrible acts of brutality, massacring, raping, and torturing many of the inhabitants,
          and even decapitating nuns and priests.
